# Todo

The short story with Foam is I can use *Markdown* with *Code* and leverage *GitHub* to manage my personal knowledge.

## What I've done

1. Got it setup in Code with a couple extensions
2. Wrapped my head around the layout and structure and backlinks 
3. Established a couple of templates for daily and default notes
4. Configured [[Automatic Updates]]
5. Configured a private repo to sync to public repo for collab and transparency 

## Pivot

- Moved to [[Obsidian]]  to manage the markdown notes of my 2nd brain


## Todo


1. Import more notes and historical data
2. Integrations
   1. Calendar
   2. Chatbot
   3. Email
3. Iterate
