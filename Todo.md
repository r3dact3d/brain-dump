# Todo

The short story with Foam is I can use *Markdown* with *VS Code* and leverage *GitHub* to manage my personal knowledge.

## What I've done

1. Got it setup in Code with a couple extensions
2. Wrapped my head around the layout and structure and backlinks 
3. Established templates for daily, meetings, ideas, journeys, and default notes
4. Configured [[Automatic Updates]] 
5. Configured a private repo to sync to public repo for collab and transparency 

## [[Recipes]]

Extensions used in VS Code
- Web Clipper


## Ideas

1. Import more notes and historical data
2. Integrations
   1. Calendar
   2. Chatbot
   3. Email
3. Iterate
