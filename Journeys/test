Let's scrape my blog post landing page at https://r3dact3d.github.io and see what this pattern called **enrich_blog_post** returns from the **Jina AI Journey.md integrated tool. As the pattern name implies, it is designed to take a markdown blog site url and return enrichments to the code. > In my example, the output is being saved in a new markdown file in my Foam directory that gets synced with GitHub. ```bash fabric -p enrich_blog_post -o /home/r3dact3d/working/foamy-stuff/dump.md -u https://r3dact3d.github.io --dry-run ```
