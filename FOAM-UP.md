# FOAM-UP

The short story with Foam is I can use *Markdown* with *Code* and leverage *GitHub* to manage my personal knowledge.

## What I've done

1. Got it setup in Code with a couple extensions
2. Wrapped my head around the layout and structure and backlinks 
3. Established a couple of templates for daily and default notes

## Todo

1. Import more notes and historical data
2. Integrations
   1. Calendar
   2. Chatbot
   3. Email
3. Iterate
