# STT-TTS Walkthrough

## Instructions
### Objectives
- Learn how to configure speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) settings in an admin panel.
- Understand the different models available for STT and TTS.
- Configure and test the STT and TTS models for effective use.

### Instructions
1. **Access the Admin Panel**:
   - Go to the admin panel and navigate to the settings.
   - Locate the audio tab.

2. **Configure Speech-to-Text (STT) Settings**:
   - Choose between Whisper local, OpenAI API call, and Web API.
   - For Whisper local, select from available models: tiny, base, small, medium, large, and turbo.
     - Example: Type "tiny English only" to download and use the tiny English model.
   - For OpenAI API call, configure to use the Whisper one model.

3. **Configure Text-to-Speech (TTS) Settings**:
   - For Web API, select any available option (note: quality may be poor).
   - For OpenAI, choose between two TTS models (recommended: TTS one).
   - Select a voice option from the available choices (e.g., Alloy, Nova).
     - Example: Choose "Nova" and save the settings.

4. **Test the STT and TTS Configurations**:
   - Speak into the microphone to test the STT configuration.
     - Example: Say "Hello, how are you?" and check the transcription.
   - Use the speaker button to test the TTS configuration.
     - Example: Listen to the AI's response to ensure the selected voice is working correctly.

5. **Engage in a Verbal Conversation**:
   - Use the configured STT and TTS settings to have a verbal conversation with the AI.
   - Interrupt and ask questions as needed.
     - Example: Ask about the need for a nuclear power plant for AI computation and listen to the AI's response.

6. **Review and Adjust Settings**:
   - Ensure that both STT and TTS models are configured appropriately.
   - Make any necessary adjustments based on the testing results.
