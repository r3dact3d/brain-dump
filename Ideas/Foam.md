# Foam

As part of my work and due partly to my personality, I do a lot of discovery and research through out the day.  I was looking for a way to take better notes to reflect on and eventually integrate into my AI [RAG] pipeline so that I can have generative conversations with my notes.  

> I won't go into detail about all the options I considered, but I decided to use Foam for my new [Second Brain](../readme.md) for the following reasons.

- It uses the markdown format, so easy to use and readme.md
- Opensource and east to start using [Foam] in vs code with just a few extensions
- I can keep my files complete private and local if I want
- I can sync with GitHub between devices.

## Templates


## Syncing

In my notes I have notes that I want to share with the public for collaboration, however there are also some notes that are private or confidential that I don't want to expose to the public.

## Backup

Created a process to sync my **Private** and **Public** notes called [[Automatic Updates]]
