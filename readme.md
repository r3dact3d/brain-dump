# Second Brain

Welcome to my second brain, powered by [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/). This is a collection of my notes and ideas, organized in a way that allows for easy navigation, interconnectivity, and discovery.

## About Me

[Add a brief introduction about yourself.]

## Table of Contents

- [[Inbox]] - a place to write down quick notes to be categorized later
- [[Todo]] - a place to keep track of things to do
- [[Projects]]
- [[Ideas]]
- [[Tools]]
  
## Getting Started

If you're new to my second brain, here are some tips to help you navigate:

- Use the search bar to find specific notes or ideas.
- Click on a link to navigate to a related note.
- Use the back button to return to the previous note.
- Use the graph view to explore the interconnections between notes.
